      <h2>Discovering UMD</h2>
         <p>The University of Minnesota Duluth, also known as UMD, is a medium-sized university located in Duluth, MN.  I chose UMD because it is a good school for accounting.  It is also well-connected, progressive, and is in a nice location.  I enjoy the city of Duluth and the proximity to Lake Superior and UMD is at the heart of it all.

        <h3>My Experiences at UMD</h3>
         <p> I currently live on-campus at UMD and have had a great time making friends with the people on my floor and customizing my dorm.  I am in University Honors and have had a blast doing activities within the honors community and connecting with the greater Duluth community through volunteering or visiting different attractions and businesses.  Some of the places around campus that I have explored and enjoyed include the Bagley nature area, the Tweed Museum of Art, and the Malosky stadium.</p>

        <h3>The Perks of Duluth</h3>
         <p>The city of Duluth is a great area and is known for having good public transportation which is particularly helpful as a college student without a car in the city.  Duluth is also home to a good variety of different stores and restaurants as well as beauties of nature.  Duluth has a lot of the same comforts as my home, however, it is different enough to give me something new to explore.  I really like the downtown area/Canal Park because of the businesses down there such as the Zeitgeist theater and Pizza Luce. </p>
