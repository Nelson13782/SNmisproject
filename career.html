        <h4>Why I am Interested</h4>
            <p>	I am interested in working for Pitzl & Pitzl which is an accounting firm located in the Twin Cities area.  They look to hire accounting interns with a focus in either tax accounting or auditing.  While I am still incredibly new to the accounting world, I believe that I would make a good addition to their team in the future because I will gain more accounting experience over the next few years and will be better equipped to intern in either tax accounting or auditing.  I have always been good with numbers and I just started a volunteering opportunity with the Duluth Center for Women and Children in relation to accounting.  By the time I am advanced enough to begin working as one of their interns, I will already have experience with accounting in a community setting and not just in the classroom.

        <h4>Why I am Interested</h4>
            <p>	I am also interested in working for Olsen Thielen which is a CPA firm also located in the Twin Cities Area.  They look to hire accounting interns for both their tax and auditing departments as well as their Client Accounting Solutions (CAS) department.  I believe that I would make a great addition to their team because they offer base camps for students with two or more completed accounting classes as a way to get involved with the firm before starting an internship with them.  By the end of the year, I will be qualified to attend their base camp and, within a few years, I will have enough credits to intern for them.  They also look for interns that are on the right track to take the CPA exam, which is something that I plan to take.  I will also have hands-on experience in accounting outside of the classroom due to my volunteer accounting experience with the Duluth Center for Women and Children, which sets me apart from other accounting students.
