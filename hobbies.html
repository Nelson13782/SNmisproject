           <h2>Spending Time Outdoors</h2>
             <p> I frequently go on nature walks at local parks and paths to take in some sunshine and fresh air.  Some of my favorite walks have been with friends and family at various state parks, especially during the fall when the leaves start to change color.  One of the most breath-taking views I have experienced was during a hike I went on with my family in South Dakota where I got to see the mountainous landscape for miles on end.</p>

            <h3>The Importance of Spending Time Outdoors</h3>
             <p> I really enjoy going on nature walks because they make me feel more grounded and connected to nature.  I have gained a greater appreciation for the outdoors and the smaller things in life by putting myself at ease while exploring nature.  I have gotten to see more of the areas local to me that I would have never discovered if I did not spend time outdoors, and I have gotten to witness breath-taking views during some of my nature walks.

             <h2>Traveling</h2>
             <p> I absolutely adore traveling!  I have been to over 20 states and 3 countries outside of the US.  My favorite destination so far was France where I got to explore the country with some of my friends.  I explored Paris and the surrounding suburbs as well as some of the gorgeous cities located in the Cote d’Azur.  I had some of the best food while I was there and I got to climb the Eiffel Tower.

             <h3>The Importance of Traveling</h3>
            <p>I think traveling is one of the best things a person can do–especially if they travel outside of the country.  I learned so much about myself and grew way more confident as I explored cultural differences on my own, particularly when I stayed with a host family in France.</p>

            <h2>Art</h2>
            <p> I enjoy creating art in my free time, especially ceramics, drawing, and photography.  I learned a lot about the different forms of art through classes I took in highschool, particularly ceramics.  I enjoy drawing and photography in my free time and would love to do ceramics more in the future.  I find creating art to be very relaxing and a different experience from my day-to-day life because I can let my mind take its own path and I can be more creative.

            <h3>The Importance of Art</h3>
            <p>I believe creating art is an essential part to being human.  Creating art allows us to relax and explore the world around us, while also creating a new world in our own minds. I think it is important to fuel our creativity and find various ways to express it because that is one of the main things that make us humans and define us culturally.</p>
